Lab 10 requires building a working "frogger" style game in P5. I desigined a very simple, two road, 3 car frogger with simple rectangles and an ellipse. Using class options I created a 'car' for the arrays to be defined through that contain size, color, etc...) The 'frogger' class is similar but more stagnant in design, using keybinds with 'keyIsDown' for arrow key based basic movement. It's 'too smooth' for a retro hopper like 'frogger' but it works. The boundaries and movement work the only issue comes from a lack of collision right now. I am working on that however. Also, one of the cars, the third array defined one I tried to get to go against the current momentum using negative variables but it just kept glitching out so that's also a WIP. (If I can figure it out I'll try and change it up.)
